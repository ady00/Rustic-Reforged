  "book.rusticreforged.text.cabinets": "Cabinets are a nicer-looking alternative to chests. They can be oriented in any of the four cardinal directions, and can also be mirrored, allowing for many different placement configurations. Placing a cabinet on top of an existing single cabinet will connect the two to form a double cabinet, as long as they are oriented the same way. Cabinets as many items as a single chest, and double cabinets can as many items as a double chest. Cabinets can only be opened from the front.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.rope": "Rope can be used as a replacement for ladders, for decoration, or for growing grapes. Ropes can be placed horizontally off of solid blocks, or vertically, hanging from a solid block or more rope. Using rope on an existing rope block will attempt to place the rope in your hand underneath the rope block. This allows you to easily create long lines of vertical rope. Dispensers with rope inside can mimic this behavior if pointed at a rope block.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.rope_1": "Ropes can also be tied to crop stakes. Tied crop stakes count as solid blocks for supporting rope. Shooting a rope with an arrow will break the rope.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.chain": "Chain can be used as a replacement for ladders, or for decoration. Chains can be placed horizontally off of solid blocks, or vertically, hanging from a solid block or more chain. Using chain on an existing chain block will attempt to place the chain in your hand underneath the chain block. This allows you to easily create long lines of vertical chain.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.candles": "Candles are decorative light sources. They can be placed on the sides or top of solid blocks, just like torches. They look especially nice when placed on the sides of a chandelier ring.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.chandeliers": "Chandeliers are blocks that are useful for decoration, as torches and candles can be placed on the sides of the block. Chandeliers will fall unless connected to a rope, chain, or solid block above them, and a falling chandelier will do massive damage to anything unfortunate enough to be underneath it.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.lanterns": "Lanterns emit light, making them a more stylish alternative to torches. They can be placed on any face of a block.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.lattice": "Lattice is a decorative block. It will connect to adjacent lattice blocks, solid blocks, and chains. Using leaves on a lattice block will give the lattice a leafy covering.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.tables": "Tables are decorative blocks. The planks used in crafting affect the type of table you get. Tables connect to adjacent tables so that only the corners of connected tables have legs.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.chairs": "Chairs are decorative blocks. The planks used in crafting affect the type of chair you get. Right-clicking a chair will allow you to sit in it, and sneaking will allow you to dismount.",

  "book.rusticreforged.text.bees": "Bees can be found in beehives throughout the world, and can be used to produce honeycomb. Beehives can be found in trees, underneath leaves. To get bees from the hive, just break the hive block.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.apiaries": "In order to use any bees you find, you must make them a new home. When bees are housed in the apiary, they will reproduce, create honeycomb, and also fertilize nearby crops, speeding up their growth. Bees will fertilize crops within four blocks of their apiary horizontally, and one block vertically. The rate at which bees create honeycomb, reproduce, and fertilize crops is dependent on the number of bees in the apiary.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.honeycomb": "The honeycomb produced by bees has a number of uses. It can be smelted into beeswax, for use in candles, it can be used as an ingredient in alchemy, or it can be crushed in a crushing tub to get liquid honey.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.honey": "Honey comes from crushing honeycomb. It can be drank from a bottle, or brewed into mead. When placed in the world, it slows down anything that tries to move through it.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.fertile_soil": "Fertile soil acts like vanilla farmland, but it doesn't require water to stay hydrated, it can't be trampled, and sugar cane can grow on it without an adjacent water block.",

  "book.rusticreforged.text.tomatoes": "Tomatoes are the fruit of tomato plants, which can be grown on crop stakes. Tomato seeds can be found by breaking tall grass, and can be planted by interacting with a crop stake with the seeds in hand. The seeds can only be planted on crop stakes that are above farmland or fertile soil. Tomato seeds will then grow into vines, which will eventually grow tomatoes.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.tomatoes_1": "Tomato vines can grow upwards onto crop stakes, but only up to a height of three blocks tall. Tomatoes can be harvested from fully grown tomato vines by interacting with a fully grown vine, or by breaking the vine. It is better not to break the vine, however, because broken vines will have to grow back before producing more tomatoes. Tomatoes can be eaten, but they can also be thrown (sneak while using), which has been known to induce shame in victims.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.chili_peppers": "Chili peppers are the fruit of chili pepper plants, which can be grown on crop stakes. Chili Pepper seeds can be found by breaking tall grass, and can be planted by interacting with a crop stake with the seeds in hand. The seeds can only be planted on crop stakes that are above farmland or fertile soil. When mature, chili pepper plants produce chili peppers. When the plant has chili peppers, it can also grow upward onto crop stakes, but only up to a height of 2 blocks tall.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.chili_peppers_1": "Chili peppers can be harvested from mature plants by interacting with or breaking the plant. It is better not to break the plant, as broken plants will need to regrow before bearing more chili peppers. Chili peppers can be eaten, but doing so will cause some fire damage due to the spiciness of the crop. However, eating them also gives a short buff to the consumer's speed. Chili peppers can also be used as an alchemy ingredient.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.wildberries": "Wildberries come from wildberry bushes. Wildberry bushes spawn naturally throughout the overworld in warm, but not dry climates. Wildberries can be harvested from fully grown bushes by interacting with the bush. Breaking the bush also works, but then the bush must be replaced.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.wildberries_1": "Wildberry bushes will not reproduce naturally, but bonemeal can be applied to make them spread. Wildberries can be eaten, but they are not very filling. However, they can be eaten faster than normal foods, and they grow very quickly.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.wildberry_juice": "Crushing wildberries in a crushing tub yields the berries' juice. When drank from a bottle, wildberry juice fills some hunger and saturation, with a chance of providing a regeneration buff, and a smaller chance of poisoning the consumer. Wildberry juice can also be brewed into wildberry wine.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.grapes": "Grapes come from grape vines, which are grown with grape seeds on farmland or fertile soil. Grape seeds can be found by breaking vines. Grape seeds grow into grape stems, which, if they have horizontal ropes above them, grow onto the ropes, forming vines. The vines then spread one block outward along the rope, so long as there is rope to grow onto. The outer vines will grow grapes so long as there isn't a block directly underneath them.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.grapes_1": "Grapes can be harvested from grape vines by interacting with or breaking fully grown vines. It is better not to break the vine, as broken vines must regrow before producing more grapes. Grapes can be eaten, taking half as long to eat as normal foods.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.grape_juice": "Grape juice can be made by crushing grapes in a crushing tub. It can be drank from a bottle, or brewed into wine.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.apple_trees": "Apple trees can be grown from apple saplings, which grow from apple seeds. Apple seeds can be obtained by crushing apples in a crushing tub. Apple trees produce oak wood, but apple trees are much better at producing apples than normal oak trees. Apple leaves slowly grow apples inside of themselves if they are exposed to air (unless they are only exposed to air from the top).",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.apple_trees_1": "Fully grown apples can be harvested from apple leaves by either interacting with or breaking the leaf block. It is better not to break leaves, as leaves will not regrow. Apple leaves drop apple saplings, as well as any apples they contained when destroyed.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.apple_juice": "Apple juice is produced along with apple seeds from crushing apples in a crushing tub. It can be drank from a bottle, or brewed into cider.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.olive_trees": "Olive trees grow naturally in the overworld in forests, plains, and mountains, but not in places where it can snow. The logs can be crafted into olive wood planks, which can be used to make olive wood variants of many wood blocks. Olive leaves drop olive saplings and olives. Raw, unprocessed olives should not be consumed, as they contain some harmful toxins.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.olive_oil": "Crushing olives in a crushing tub yields olive oil. Olive oil is much to flavorful to be consumed by itself, it is much better to combine it with food items in a crafting table. Doing so will add the olive oil to the food, which makes the food more filling and more saturating. Olive oil can be applied to virtually any food.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.ironwood_trees": "Ironwood Trees grow naturally in the overworld in forests, plains, mountains, swamps, and jungles. They do not grow naturally in dry biomes. The logs can be crafted into ironwood planks, which can be used to make ironwood variants of many wood blocks. Ironwood leaves drop ironwood saplings and ironberries.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.ironberry_juice": "Ironberry Juice come from crushing ironberries in a crushing tub. It can be drank, if stored in a bottle, but doing so paralyzes the consumer. Ironberry juice is better used for brewing iron wine, or for getting iron dust.",

  "book.rusticreforged.text.alchemy": "Alchemy is the process of brewing elixirs in condensers. Alchemy is done in condensers, which are require retorts to be attached to them. Creating elixirs requires water, a glass bottle, ingredients (and optionally modifiers), as well as fuel to operate the condenser. Any furnace fuel should work.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.alchemy_basic": "A basic condenser can be used to make elixirs with two ingredients or fewer. In order to operate, basic condensers must have two retorts attached to them, one on the left, and one on the right, relative to the direction the condenser is facing. The retorts themselves must be facing the condenser, so that their tubes are connected to it. Condensers have an internal tank, which can be filled or emptied by interacting with the condenser with a bucket.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.alchemy_basic_1": "Interacting with the condenser with an empty hand while sneaking will totally empty the internal tank, destroying any fluid stored inside. The fluid in the tank can be seen in the condenser's GUI. The two slots on the left of the GUI are for ingredients, and the exact configuration of ingredients in these slots is meaningless. The slot on the top-right of the condenser's GUI is for glass bottles, and the large slot beneath that is the condenser's output slot.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.alchemy_basic_2": "The slot in the bottom-middle of the gui is for fuel. If you are using a basic condenser, it is recommended that you upgrade to an advanced condenser as soon as possible.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.alchemy_advanced": "Advanced condensers are very similar to their more basic counterpart, but they have a few key differences. First, instead of regular retorts, they require advanced retorts, and they need three advanced retorts attached to them in order to operate. The advanced retorts must be attached on the bottom half of the advanced condenser, on the left, right, and back sides, relative to the direction the advanced condenser is facing.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.alchemy_advanced_1": "Advanced condensers can also be used to create elixirs with up to three ingredients, as well as another ingredient called a modifier. Modifiers can optionally be added to most recipes, and they can change certain aspects of the resulting elixir. In the advanced condenser's GUI, modifiers can be added in the slot located in the top-middle of the interface, directly above the fuel slot. The GUI also has a third ingredient slot, over the basic condenser's two.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.alchemy_advanced_2": "Finally, advanced condensers are moderatley faster than basic ones. Any elixir that can be made in a basic condenser can also be made in an advanced condenser.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.alcoholic_beverages": "Alcoholic beverages, or booze, can be created by brewing certain fluids in a brewing barrel. Such beverages can provide unique and poweful effects if used correctly, but can otherwise lead to disastrous consequences. All booze has a quality between 0 and 1. Drinking booze with a quality of at least 0.5 will have a positive effect, and drinking booze with a quality below 0.5 will have negative effects.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.alcoholic_beverages_1": "The strength or duration of either sort of effect is relative to the quality of the booze, with the strength/duration increasing as the quality approaches 0 or 1. If you aquire booze with a quality below 0.5, it is best so simply dispose of it. For convenience, simply placing a bottle of booze in a crafting table will return an empty glass bottle.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.alcoholic_beverages_2": "Regardless of the quality of your drink, there is always a chance that drinking alcohol beverages will inebriate you. Inebriation is a debuff, but it cannot be cured with milk. Continuing to drink while inebriated can increase the duration and severity of the effect. An inebriation debuff of level I or II, will do nothing. At level III, the debuff will continuously inflict slowness I and blindness I on it's victim. At level IV, it inflicts slowness II, blindess I, and nausea II.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.ale": "Ale is a very saturating drink, and it applies the Full Stomach effect, which decreases damage taken from starvation.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.ale_wort": "Ale is brewed with ale wort, which is made by combining a water bucket, bread, and sugar in a crafting table.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.cider": "Cider applies magic resistance effect, which reduces damage taken from magical sources, including poison.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.iron_wine": "Iron wine grants the drinker absorption hearts with no time limit, up to ten extra hearts.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.mead": "Mead applies the wither ward effect, which reduces damage taken from the wither effect.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.wildberry_wine": "Wildberry wine increases the level of all positive effects, up to level III.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.wine": "Wine increases the duration of all positive effects by up to ten minutes.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.brewing": "Brewing is the process of fermenting fluids to get alcohol, and it is done with a brewing barrel. The brewing process involves up to three fluids: the input, the output, and optionally the starter culture fluid. Starter culture fluid can only be added to a recipe if it is the same type of fluid as the recipe's output. A brewing barrel's interface has three tanks for holding these fluids, as well as a slot above and below each tank.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.brewing_1": "The slots above the tanks are used for inputing and/or outputing from each tank by placing either full or empty fluid containers, like buckets or bottles, inside of them. The barrel will attempt to fill tanks from full fluid containers, and empty tanks into empty containers. The result of either interaction appears in the slot beneath the relevant tank. The tank in the middle of the interface is for inputs, the tank on the right is for outputs.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.brewing_2": "The tank on the left is for starter culture fluids.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.brewing_3": "The brewing process takes half of a day (10 minutes), and will commence as soon as any amount of valid fluid is in the input tank, as long as either the starter culture tank is empty, or the fluid in the starter culture tank is valid for the input's recipe. Brewing without any fluid in the starter culture tank will produce an output with a random quality between 0.05 and 0.75.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.brewing_4": "Brewing with some pre-brewed booze in the starter culture tank can negate most of the randomness, and will insure that the quality of the output is no less than the quality of the starter culture booze minus 0.01, and no greater than the quality of the starter culture booze plus 0.04. For example, putting honey in the input tank and mead with a quality of 0.7 in the starter culture tank will produce mead with a quality between 0.69 and 0.74.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.brewing_5": "Fluid in the starter culture tank is not consumed in the brewing process.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.brewing_6": "The best way to go about brewing is to continue making booze with random qualities until you get something with a quality around 0.5, although higher is better. Then, use that as a starter culture for the next batch, and if the product of that is of a greater quality than the preivious batch, use the new stuff as a starter culture for another batch, and so forth, until a satisfactory quality has been achieved.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.crushing": "Crushing tubs are used to crush solids into liquids. They can hold up to one stack of items, and up to eight buckets of liquid. To use a crushing tub, place it in the world an insert items into it by interacting with the block with items in hand. Remove items by interacting with the tub with an empty hand. Once a tub has items inside, if the items are a valid recipe, jumping on the tub will crush the items into their corresponding fluid, one at a time.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.crushing_1": "If the tub is too full of fluid, crushing will not occur. If necessary, you can void all fluid contained in the tub by interacting with the block with an empty hand while sneaking. Some crushing recipes produce both fluid and items. If a recipe has an item byproduct, then the item will appear in the world above the tub when crushing occurs.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.drying": "Drying basins are used to extract items from fluids through evaporation. They can hold up to one stack of items, and up to six buckets of liquid. To use an evaporation basin, place it in the world. Then, insert fluid into it by interacting with the block with a filled bucket in hand. Remove fluid by interacting with the block with an empty bucket in hand, or by interacting with the basin with an empty hand while sneaking, which destroys any fluid in the basin.",
  "book.rusticreforged.text.drying_1": "Evaporating will occur automatically over time. Fluid in the basin evaporates at a rate of 1/50 of a bucket every second. Once enough fluid has evaporated to form a valid recipe, the output will appear in the basin, assuming there is space in the basin's inventory. Items can be extracted by interacting with the basin with an empty hand."
